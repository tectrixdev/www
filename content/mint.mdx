**Disclaimer: _this article is based on personal opinion and partial speculation._**

As we all know [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) is probably still the most known [Linux](https://www.linux.org) distro, but most of the community finds that it has some flaws. Like snap for example, a very much hated package manager similar to [flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org) but with a much more aggressive approach to sandboxing. [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com), the company behind [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) thinks otherwise and wants you to use them. Speaking of which, most of the communtiy also doesn't like that it's managed by a company. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) takes a more commercial approach, which doesn't make it bad but does have some conflicts with the general idea of [Linux](https://www.linux.org): Freedom, openness, FOSS, ...

What does this all have to do with mint? You might ask. Well, mint is (partially) based on [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) but doesn't have some of it's tradeoffs. For example, as far as I know it doesn't use or recommend snap, it isn't owned by a (large) company. This makes some people see mint as "the better [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com)".

Why is mint the most recommended beginner distro today? Well, I think it's mostly because it existed way back in 2006 and was there when [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) started to take a more commercial approach. Basically, it was a good distro back then, they made some big changes throughout the years and focused on their users. The users probably recommended the distro as they probably really liked it. And this continued until now.
And with social media it's existence was well known and it was getting recommended all over due to its simplicity.

# Personal opinion

Most experienced [Linux](https://www.linux.org) users have probably wondered more than once, why is [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com) the chosen "beginner friendly" distro?
First of all, let's see some examples of the media recommending Mint, even when you search for [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com) on your favorite search engine (I used [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) here)

You will come across some articles recommending it, which is not a bad thing to clarify, [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com) isn't bad it's just that I and some other [Linux](https://www.linux.org) users think windows users going to [Linux](https://www.linux.org) deserve better.

On its own, the [Linux](https://www.linux.org) distro isn't that bad, considering that it's based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org) which makes it easy to understand and use for beginners.
The community support is great although this is the case for most distro's. Most things about this distro are pretty solid.

But, if we start looking at distro's like [bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) for example. They offer gnome or [KDE](https://www.kde.org) as desktop enviroment, fedora atomic for smooth updating + added stability and rollback features. They also offer "just" which is a command line tool with some built-in scripts to make using this os and installing programs like davinci easier for the user. These scripts are all officially supported which makes them very stable and handy.

In comparison to mint which is simple but still "just" based on debian and offers cinnamon, XFCE or mate as desktop enviroment. Although these are very performant and simple I personally think there are more beautiful or polished DEs out there like gnome and KDE.

I think that users switching over to [Linux](https://www.linux.org) are mostly attracted by looks because that's the first thing they notice when installing "[Linux](https://www.linux.org)" (they are installing a distro but they probably just see it as [Linux](https://www.linux.org)) and as everyone is seeing this as the beginner distro, this might be their first impression of [Linux](https://www.linux.org). So I would give them the best and most modern DE's so they can have a great first impression. [KDE](https://www.kde.org) which is my personal favorite for example has so much customizability that this would blow away previous windows users. And gnome offers stability, great defaults and overall performance.

Overall, I would say that mint is in fact a great distro, but personally I think it could be better. Especially the default desktop enviroment. And btw, I would recommend [fedora kde](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/) for customization freaks, [fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) for stability and productivity freaks. and lastly [aurora](https://getaurora.dev/) for the beginners or stability and customizability freaks. (notice the fedora trend here ;) )
